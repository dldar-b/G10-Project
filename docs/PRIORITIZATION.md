# 🎚️ Requirements Prioritization
**Role 5 – Omar Emad**

The requirements were prioritized using the **MoSCoW** method:  
- **M (Must Have)** – Core and essential features.  
- **N (Nice to Have)** – Important but can be added later.  
- **S (Superfluous)** – Optional and cosmetic features.

## Prioritization Table
| Requirement | Priority | Justification |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Login & Registration | M | Necessary for access and identity management |
| Service Booking | M | Central functionality of the platform |
| Search & Filter | M | Improves user experience |
| Provider Schedule | M | Ensures no booking conflicts |
| Reviews & Ratings | N | Builds trust but not critical for MVP |
| Online Payment | N | Can be added after initial release |
| Dark Mode | S | Visual preference only |

This prioritization ensures focus on essential features first while keeping room for future enhancements.
